[University Physics Competition](https://uphysicsc.com/) (UPC) is an annual event that undergraduates can partake in to solve a physics problem and writing a formal paper within 48 hours. We were a team of three and this is my second UPC.

## The paper

## The doodle

We tried problem B and got stuck so we switch to problem A

[Here's the .ipynb](/blog/upc-2021/upc_2021_351A.ipynb) for this paper.

## Retrospect

This was definitely the most challenging since I don't have the most clear visualization when it comes to thermodynamics. This would also be the case if we chose problem B since we couldn't think of a way to develop the math to describe the height of the water after asteroid impact. The time constrained forced us to stay in one problem.

Even though this also got bronze, I can't say that it was as fulfilling. I don't have more to say other than I need more study...
